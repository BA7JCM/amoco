The user interface package
==========================

The amoco user interface is meant to display informations about a binary
in a much more useful way than what can be shown on a simple terminal.
Ideally, we want to allow rich graphic display without losing the
ability to develop programs that access all parts of the framework API.

One approach is to have a GUI application that has the ability to run
"scripts" when required, either loaded from a file or from a dedicated
GUI widget that provides interactive input/output from/to the user.

Running the framework inside a graphical user interface
is to limit possible actions to a very small set of predefined
operations.
